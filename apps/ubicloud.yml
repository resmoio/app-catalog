description: Ubicloud is an open, free, and portable cloud that offers infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) features on 
  providers that lease bare metal instances, such as Hetzner, OVH, and AWS Bare Metal. It is an alternative to public 
  cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Ubicloud reduces costs, avoids lock-in, and returns control of your 
  infrastructure back to you. It is available as a managed service and is ~3x cheaper than AWS. Ubicloud provides Elastic 
  Compute, Virtual Networking, Block Storage, Attribute-Based Access Control, and a Cloud Console.
