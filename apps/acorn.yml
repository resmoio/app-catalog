description: Acorn.io is a cloud platform that allows developers to build, share, and run containerized applications. It 
  provides a comprehensive way to describe your application and dependencies in a single file called an Acornfile. Acorn 
  images can be created from Docker images, databases, serverless functions, storage buckets, and other containerized 
  applications. Acorn images can be launched in your cloud sandbox with just one click. Acorn provides monitoring, logging, 
  secret management, auto-scaling, and debugging tools out of the box to make operations a snap. Acorn is built on AWS and 
  is designed for scalability, performance, and reliability.
