description: Duo is a software application focused on cybersecurity, offering services such as multi-factor
  authentication (MFA) and single sign-on solution. The app aims at ensuring user authenticity by seeking
  additional verification through a secondary device or security key, apart from the usual username and
  password. This two-factor authentication (2FA) increases the security of user data by adding an extra
  layer, making it difficult for unauthorized individuals to provide both factors required for access.
