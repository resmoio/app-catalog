description: WarpStream is a Kafka compatible data streaming platform built directly on top of object storage. It is designed
  to be infinitely scalable and is deployed as a stateless and auto scaling agent binary in your VPC with no local disks 
  to manage. WarpStream is protocol compatible with Apache KafkaÂ® and Kinesis, so you can keep using all your favorite
  tools and software. It is cheaper than Kafka and costs the same regardless of whether you run your workloads in a 
  single availability zone or distributed across multiple.
