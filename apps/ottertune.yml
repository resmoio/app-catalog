description: OtterTune is an intelligent database tuning tool designed to optimize the performance of database management 
  systems (DBMS) automatically. It utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze database workloads, identify performance
  bottlenecks, and suggest configuration changes to enhance the overall efficiency of the database. OtterTune works with 
  popular database systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and others, helping database administrators and developers fine-tune
  their systems without extensive manual intervention. By automating the tuning process, OtterTune aims to improve the 
  performance, reliability, and scalability of databases, ultimately leading to better application performance and user experience.
