description: Edge Delta is an automated observability platform utilizing AI to continuously monitor services, providing 
  alerts for anomalies and guiding root-cause analysis. It eliminates the need for manual threshold definitions and predicts 
  conditions to monitor, allowing for efficient anomaly detection. The platform summarizes log data, streamlining the 
  identification of changes and affected resources with each alert. With a distributed architecture, Edge Delta facilitates
  cost-effective observability at scale, enabling users to store and search all their data without the need for sampling 
  or filtering to control costs.
